## 💡 The Problem

Does this sound familiar?

- Reports named `2026-02-14`, `02.14.2026`, `14/02/2026` — impossible to sort, impossible to find
- Is `02/14/2026` February 14th or the 2nd of a nonexistent month? Ambiguous dates cause costly errors
- Team members constantly asking "How should I format this date?" — wasting valuable time

**Small inconsistencies add up to big headaches.**

## ✨ The Solution

### How It Works

1. **Choose Your Format** — Select from yyyyMMdd, yyyy/MM/dd, yyyy.MM.dd, or yyyy年MM月dd日
2. **Run Once** — Extract and run the .exe file. No installation required. Works silently in the background.
3. **Press Insert** — Anywhere you're typing—documents, emails, file names—press the **Insert key** for perfect formatting

**One key. One format. Every time.**

## 🎯 Key Benefits
